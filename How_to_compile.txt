 Guide for compilation of G+Smo and shapeopt
=============================================
NOTE: it is important that everything is done in the appropiate folder, such that you dont mess up the gismo folder with build file.. If you ar unlucky to build in the gismo folder you can clean up by running a command (DONT REMEMBER NAME ATM)

Go to you git directory, e.g.

	$ mkdir git
	$ cd git

Clone G+SMO from GitHub

	$ git clone https://github.com/gismo/gismo.git

Switch to the Improved Expressions branch and fetch code

	$ git checkout ImproveExpressions
	$ git fecht (note: perhaps this step is not necessary)

Make a build folder that is seperate and go into this folder

	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build

Run cmake from the build folder linking to the source code

	$ cmake ../gismo

Run ccmake to choose the necessary options

	$ ccmake .

Choose options:

	CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE : RelWithDebInfo (To allow debugging, only use Release mode for fast execution when program is correct)

	GISMO_WITH_IPOPT : ON		(Gets and compiles Ipopt to do optimization)
	GISMO_BUILD_EXAMPLES : ON   (Builds examples)

Press [c] and then [g] to generate

Use the new settings by running cmake

	$ cmake .

Build with make 

	$ make -j 3 (To use 3 cores)
